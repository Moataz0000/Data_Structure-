# Data Structures Implementation

This repository contains implementations of various data structures in Python. The goal is to provide clear, well-documented examples of fundamental data structures used in computer science.

## Included Data Structures
- Stack

--- 



- **Stack** is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle.
    > Think of it like a stack of pancakes - you can only add or remove pancakes from the top.
    
    - Basic operations we can do on a stack are:
        - Push: Adds a new element on the stack.
        - Pop: Removes and returns the top element from the stack.
        - Peek: Returns the top (last) element on the stack.
        - isEmpty: Checks if the stack is empty.
        - Size: Finds the number of elements in the stack.

        - **Example implementation:** [stack.py](./stack.py)
